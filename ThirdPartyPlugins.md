# Plugins #

Some people have provided third-party plugins that extend the abilities of Spam Karma.  The following can be downloaded from their respective web pages:

  * [Akismet plugin](http://www.sebbi.de/archives/2006/01/31/spam-karma-2-akismet-plugin/) -- by Sebastian Herp -- Uses the [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) anti-spam system as just one of the tests within Spam Karma
  * [Moderate plugin](http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/sk2-moderate-plugin/) -- by Peter Westwood -- Forces all comments through moderation, regardless of "karma" score.

Also note that some of the plugins included in the main Spam Karma download were created by third parties.  These are:

  * RBL Check plugin -- by James Seward -- Checks comment IP and URLs against Realtime Blacklist servers
  * [Simple Digest plugin](http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/sk2-simple-digest-plugin/) -- by Peter Westwood -- Sends the blog admin digest emails about recent activity by Spam Karma
